# Setup
For starters, we'll need something to code with; in this case, we'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).<br>
Once we have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed, we'll get the [Chattriggers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maxssho13.chattriggers) to help us with auto-completion and documentation.
