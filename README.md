> This guide is only for [Chattriggers 2.2.0](https://github.com/ChatTriggers/ChatTriggers/releases/tag/2.2.0)<br>
> Check out the [Chattriggers Slate](https://chattriggers.com/slate/) to learn the basics<br>
> If you don't know anything about javascript please read the basics of [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

# Setup
For starters, we'll need something to code with; in this case, we'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).<br>
Once we have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed, we'll get the [Chattriggers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maxssho13.chattriggers) to help us with auto-completion and documentation.

> [!WARNING]
> If you don't see a register that you want to look into, but it's in the slate, that means that the slate has enough information for it, thus not being necessary to essentially copy and paste it into here.
